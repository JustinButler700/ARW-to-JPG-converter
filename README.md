# ARW-to-JPG-converter
Quick and easy Bash script to convert all ARW files in a folder to JPGs


Dependencies: You need to have [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php) installed.

When you download Image Magick, make sure you have install legacy utilities selected.

Once these are installed, place my bash script into the folder containing your .ARW and run the script.

On Linux & Mac : ./convert.sh 
On Windows : convert.sh


It will place all converted files into a file called "converted" (within the same directory you run it)
